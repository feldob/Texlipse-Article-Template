Texlipse-Article-Template
=========================

A LaTeX template for Texlipse users. It partitions a research article into multiple projects, simplifying co-authoring and chapter merging. Articles written in one single tex file can become difficult to manage.

It contains the following Texlipse project folders:

* _Article_	:	assembles the article by including all sections, defining title, authors...

* _Material_	:	contains all article related material, bib file, style file,  file, img folder...

* _Abstract_ 	:	write Abstract here \(abstract.tex\)
* _Conclusions_ :	write Conclusions here \(conclusions.tex\)
* _Discussion_ 	:	can you guess? :)
* _Experiments_ :	...
* _Intro_ 	:	...
* _Method_ 	:	...
* _Results_ 	:	...
* _Theory_ 	:	...

Feel free to customize the structure yourself!
